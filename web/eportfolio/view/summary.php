                Since I was 15 years old, I knew that when I grew up I was going to be a lawyer in Argentina. Everything was going as planned until I met my husband who lived in the United States.
                After four years of studying law and just two years before graduation, I moved to the United States.
                After learning English, I decided to give a new direction to my career and started studying something completely different, but that I liked as much as a law: Web Design and Development.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text two">
                I am less than a year away from graduating and my skills in HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Java, jQuery, Git, GitHub, Heroku etc. have grown.
                I love to see how using these tools has allowed me to create different web page designs, increasing my interest in this area.
                I am always ready and willing to learn more, I strive to do my best.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text three">
                I always look for a way to be motivated. This helps me be more optimistic when difficulties appear. I am originally from Argentina and something I struggle with a lot is the language.
                I didn't want to talk because I was embarrassed. In recent years I started to see this challenge differently. Instead of letting the embarrassment get me, I started talking in English more.
                Even though I make mistakes, I can say this has helped me a lot, not only to communicate more, but also to know how to face problems and have a more positive attitude.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text four">
                In this career, I can combine all my passions and abilities.
                It allows me to express my creativity and ingenuity, my level of organization, my power to create and fix things, and my ability to analyze and solve problems.
