                My name is Gianna. I am a wife, a mother of a 4 year old daughter, and a student. Iâ€™m originally from Cordoba, Argentina.
                I have lived in Lehi, Utah since I got married 8 years ago.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text two">
                I am currently finishing my degree in Web Design Development at BYU-I. I am a creative person.
                I try to use my creativity within web pages and home projects.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text three">
                I always look for a way to be motivated. This helps me be more optimistic when difficulties appear. I am originally from Argentina and something I struggle with a lot is the language.
                I didn't want to talk because I was embarrassed. In recent years I started to see this challenge differently. Instead of letting the embarrassment get me, I started talking in English more.
                Even though I make mistakes, I can say this has helped me a lot, not only to communicate more, but also to know how to face problems and have a more positive attitude.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-text four">
                I like to strive in everything I do and always give more. For example, now that I am a student, when I have to do an assignment, I try to do my best to "do more." When I'm writing code and it doesn't work, I never give up.
                Although at times it can be frustrating, I like to finish what I start. After I manage to do it, I feel very capable.
